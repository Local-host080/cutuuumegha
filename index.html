        <p>Dear Cutuu,</p>
        <p>On September 19, 2024, something beautiful happened. I met a girl who, without even trying, became the most special part of my life. A simple conversation on a dating app led to our first late-night call, and I remember how I couldn't stop smiling the entire time. Your voice—so soothing, so full of warmth—was all I wanted to hear.</p>
        <p>Then, as days passed, you started calling me "Cutuu." No one had ever called me that before. And in that moment, I realized something—I wasn't just talking to any girl. I was talking to someone who was going to change my life.</p>
        <p>Through endless conversations, laughter, silly fights, and shared reels, you became the person I can't go a day without. Despite the distance between us, you make me feel close, like you're right here with me.</p>
        <p>You are the girl with a calm mind and a pure heart. You care for everyone, forgive easily, and understand even when you don’t have to. Your kindness, your warmth, your patience—it’s something rare, something precious.</p>
        <p>And then, there’s the way you look—especially when you put a bindi on your forehead and wear traditional clothes. In those moments, you don’t just look beautiful; you look like an angel. The kind of vision that stays in my heart forever.</p>
        <p>Day by day, I find myself thinking about you more. You're on my mind 24/7. No matter what I do, my thoughts always find their way back to you. And honestly? I wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>

<p>I know I'm not perfect—I'm just an ordinary guy with flaws. But somehow, with you, I feel complete. You make me better in ways I never imagined. With you, I don’t need to be perfect, because you are the missing piece that makes me whole.</p>

<p>So today, on Propose Day, I want to ask you something that’s been on my heart for so long—</p>

        <h2>Will you be mine forever, Cutuu? ❤️</h2>
